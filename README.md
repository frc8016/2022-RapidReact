# **FRC Team #8016: 2022 FIRST Forward/Rapid React Robot Code**

## **Setup:**

Please make sure you have your development environment set up. For the 2022 season, that means having installed VSCode and WPILib extensions (found [here](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html)) and git (found [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

### **Cloning**

To clone this git repository, please follow the steps outlined [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

## **Repo overview:**

This repository uses an alpha -> beta -> master branch system. The alpha branch is where all new additions are tested. Once proven that the code works at least nominally, it can be pushed to beta. In beta, code can be tuned and bugs fixed, until the code is competition ready. Once that happens, it can be pushed to master. Any code in master should be competition ready.

### **Contributing**

You must be a member of FRC team 8016 to contribute. If you're adding a feature or fixing a bug in the alpha branch, create a new branch from alpha. Make your changes there, and then open a pull request back into alpha. If you're fixing bugs or tuning values in beta or master, make a new branch from the branch you're trying to fix, make your changes, and open a pull request back into the branch you're trying to fix. Use clear, concise commit messages as outlined in [this](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#seven-rules) guide.

When creating a new branch, please name it with a description of what the branch is for, as well as your first name.

## **Code formatting:**

When editing code, please use these formatting conventions:

- Classes should be in UpperCamelCase
- Methods should be in lowerCamelCase
- Variables should be concise but descriptive, and written in lowerCamelCase
- Constants should be kept solely in the Constants class, and should be written in UPPERCASE_SEPERATED_BY_UNDERSCORES
- When you create a method, write a comment telling us what the method does, and if necessary, how it does it.
- When you create a constant, include units either in the name or in a comment to the right of the constant declaration.
- Bracketing: follow the conventions below:
```
public void ExampleMethod() {
    if(x == 1) {
        //Do something
    } else {
        //Do something else
    }
}
```
